            p When you enable customer accounts, Shopify stores password-protected information about a customer's identity, order history, and current order status. Your customers' details, such as address information, will be pre-filled from the stored information during checkout.
            p You can make customer accounts required or optional, or disable them altogether. When creating an account, customers are redirected to a separate account creation page. Keep in mind that requiring customers to create accounts might decrease sales conversions.
            p To edit your customer account settings:
            p 1. From your Shopify admin, go to 
              b Settings &gt; Checkout.

                | Customers won't see the option to create an account or to log in during checkout. They'll have to manually enter their details at checkout, because fields won't be pre-filled.

                b Accounts are optional 
                | Customers can choose to create an account, but it's not mandatory to create an account to check out. If customers do have an account and they're logged in, then their address fields are pre-filled when they place an order.

                b Accounts are required 
                | Customers need to create an account, or have an account and be logged in to complete the checkout. This setting is useful if you're running a wholesale or members-only store, for example. Address fields are pre-filled when the customer places an order.
